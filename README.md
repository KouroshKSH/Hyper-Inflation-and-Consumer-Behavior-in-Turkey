## Data Sources
To investigate the research question, the following data sources could be used:
1. **TÜİK:** TÜİK is the Turkish Statistical Institute that provides a vast amount of data on food and beverage industry revenues, consumer spending habits, retail sales, and inflation rates in Turkey.
2. **Online food ordering platforms:** Analyzing data from online food ordering platforms, such as Yemeksepeti or Getir, can provide insights into consumer preferences and spending habits for different types of food and beverage establishments.
3. **Social media:** Analyzing data from social media platforms such as Instagram, can provide insights into consumer behavior, preferences, and trends related to food and beverage industry in Turkey.

## Methods
To investigate the research question, the following methods could be used:
1. **Time series analysis:** This method could be used to track changes in consumer behavior over time and identify trends in restaurant and cafe preferences and spending habits. It can also be used to forecast future behavior of the consumers. Pandas, TensorFlow, Statsmodels libraries will be used for this method. Such tools can be used to analyze trends and patterns in data over time. In the context of our research question, time series analysis can be used to track changes in consumer behavior in the food and beverage industry over time, including changes in spending habits, restaurant and cafe preferences, and the impact of hyperinflation on these trends.

2. **Sentiment analysis:** This method could be used to analyze online reviews and ratings for different types of food and beverage establishments to gain insights into consumer attitudes and perceptions. A number of libraries are suitable for this part, such as Scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy and others, which can help with tasks such as tokenizing text, identifying parts of speech, analyzing sentiment polarity, and more.

3. **Data visualization:** This method can be used to present the findings of the analysis in a visual form and to communicate the insights to the stakeholders. Libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn can be utilized for this task.
